# Electric Car Range Calculator
This is an electric car range calculator that estimates the potential savings in your electric car's range based on different car tyre rolling resistance classes. Classes and calculations are based on European Commission's tyre labeling rules. The calculator considers five types of tyre classes, from A to E, with class A having the lowest rolling resistance and class E the highest.

# How to use the calculator
Follow these steps:

Fill in the required fields:

Battery capacity (kWh) - Enter the capacity of your electric car's battery in kilowatt-hours (kWh).

Consumption (kWh/100 km) - Enter the energy consumption rate of your electric car in kilowatt-hours per 100 kilometers (kWh/100 km).

Electricity price (€/kWh) - Enter the cost of electricity in your area in euros per kilowatt-hour (€/kWh).

Click on the "Calculate" button.

The calculator will display the estimated average range for each tyre rolling resistance class (A to E) and the range per euro spent on electricity.

# Understanding the results
The calculator provides two sets of results:

Average Range per Tyre Class - This represents the estimated average electric car range for each tyre rolling resistance class (A to E). Upgrading to a lower rolling resistance class can result in improved electric car range.

Range per Euro - This represents the estimated range in kilometers that your electric car can travel with one euro spent on electricity. This value helps you understand the cost-effectiveness of your electric car based on its energy consumption and the cost of electricity.

Keep in mind, that the results are only estimates and can vary depending on various factors such as driving style, road conditions, and weather.
The calculator is for guidance purposes only, and this application is not responsible for the accuracy of the information.
